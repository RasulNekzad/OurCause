# OurCause

Due to recent wildfire in Canada, over 30,000 Canadian residents were displaced during its peak. Wild fire also affected the air quality which even spread towards the United State.

To help these people, we decided to make our website so people can donate money and other stuff as well which can help the people who were affected.
